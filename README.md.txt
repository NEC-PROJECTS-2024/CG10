### INTRODUCTION
Customer segmentation using K-means clustering is crucial for businesses as it allows them to effectively divide their customer base into distinct groups based on similar characteristics or behaviors. By doing so, businesses can tailor their marketing strategies, product offerings, and customer experiences to meet the specific needs and preferences of each segment. This targeted approach enhances customer satisfaction, increases retention rates, and ultimately drives profitability. Additionally, customer segmentation enables businesses to identify high-value customers, prioritize resources, and allocate marketing budgets more efficiently. Overall, K-means clustering empowers businesses to gain valuable insights into their customer base, optimize their operations, and stay competitive in the market.
